# Deadwood Project

Project currently worked on by Jayson Morberg & Isaac Simon

Currently 5/9 classes have been fully implemented

(Parser, Board, Role, Scene, SceneGenerator finished)
(TODO: Player, Deadwood System, MovieSet, CastingOffice)

NOTE: board.xml & cards.xml are required to run, as the Parser class requires
them to build the appropriate objects
